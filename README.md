# MicroNanoplastic-Multispectral-Database


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Abstract

This study presents a novel smartphone-based, machine-learning-assisted multispectral classification method for identifying airborne micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs). Instead of commercial polymeric microspheres, coffee grinder-based cryogrinding generated nonuniform MNPs from real-world plastic products with highly irregular shapes and heterogenous size distributions. The low-cost handheld device comprised of a smartphone, a spectral mask array made from plastic color films, and a discrete multiplexed illumination device. A stack of images was captured across multiple wavelength ranges and the RGB ratios were extracted without using morphological information. An XGBoost model was trained on two datasets: dry and wet MNP samples passively collected on a glass slide, simulating two types of airborne MNPs. The model successfully distinguished plastics from clay with 89-99% accuracy and classified six plastic types with 79-87% accuracy for dry and wet MNPs. This method offers a promising toolkit for airborne MNP monitoring and supports using nonuniform MNPs in future research.


## Data and Code Availability

The RGB ratios extracted from multispectral image stackes of both dry and wet samples, along with automated image processing and machine learning code, have been provided in this github repository.
